The initial repository

   I got into computers and programming im 1981 when I
bought my first computer, a Commodore VIC-20. At first
I had only bought the VIC-20, no peripherals or games.
Not it was enough. It came with a book that taught the
owner the B.A.S.I.C. programming language that was coded
into the VIC-20 and I taught myself to program with it.
I fell in love. Something that did exactly what I told it
to so. I was in comtro6.
At the time there were only a few magazines in
circulation that death with Commodore computers, and I
immediately latched onto Compute!'s gazette since among
other things it featured games written for the VIC-20.
Without a disk or tape drive, I had to enter the code for
the games by hand every time, so my mom eventually got
me a tape drive and tapes. That's when I started to try
my hand at writing games of my own.
   Next I bought a Commodore 16, whoch had more memory,
and an an assembly compiler built in. So I started to
teach myself machine language so I could subroutines for
animatimg my graphics with out slowing down the rest of
the programs I was writing.
   Next i bought the Commodore Amoga 500...
